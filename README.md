# Cosmic Chicken Invasion 🚀🐔🎮

Cosmic Chicken Invasion is a retro-inspired, fast-paced space shooter game where you control a fearless farmer fighting off an army of invincible, teleporting chickens! The chickens keep getting more aggressive, and your goal is to survive and rack up the highest score while avoiding their attacks.

## 🚀 Features

- **Challenging Gameplay: The chickens get faster, and more tricky as you progress.**
-**Random Chicken Movement: Some chickens teleport, divebomb, and change directions unpredictably.**
-**Player Power-Ups: Use your pitchfork to shoot down chickens, but be careful—if they reach you, you'll lose a life!**
-**Increasing Difficulty: As your score increases, the chickens move faster, making the game more intense and thrilling.**
-**Retro Aesthetic: A classic pixelated look, paying homage to the golden age of arcade games.**

# 🕹️ Controls
-**Left/Right Arrow Keys: Move your spaceship (aka tractor) left and right.**

-**Spacebar: Fire your pitchfork to eliminate the chicken invaders.**

## 🧑‍🌾 How to Play
-**Start the Game: Press Spacebar to start the game from the main menu.**

-**Move and Shoot: Use the arrow keys to move left and right. Press Spacebar to shoot pitchforks at the chickens.**

-**Survive the Waves: Defeat chickens and avoid their attacks. If a chicken touches your tractor, you lose a life.**

-**Score and Progress: As you shoot more chickens, your score increases. As your score grows, the difficulty increases—watch out for faster chickens and tricky teleporting enemies!**

## 📈 Gameplay Mechanics
-**Chickens: They spawn from the top and move around randomly, with some even teleporting to different spots on the screen!**

-**Player: You control the tractor at the bottom of the screen, shooting pitchforks upward to defeat the chickens.**

-**Collision: If a chicken reaches the bottom of the screen or touches the player’s spaceship, you lose a life. The game ends when you run out of lives.**
